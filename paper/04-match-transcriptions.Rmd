# Matching transcriptions of imitations to seeds

We next asked whether the transcriptions of the imitations also retained
some measure of fidelity to the original sound source, as evidenced by
above chance guessing as to the "meaning" of the distal sound source.

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("R/img.R")
```
