# Selecting seeds

To pick the seeds useds in the experiment, we started with an initial set of
6 categories and 6 sounds in each category and conducted two rounds of norming
to reduce the initial set to the final set of 16 seed sounds, 4 in each of
4 categories. The norming procedure was as follows. Participants listened to
the sounds in each category and picked the one that they thought was the most
different from the others. In the first round of norming, participants listened
to 6 sounds. We removed the sounds in each category that were the most different
from the others, and repeated the norming process again with 5 sounds in each
category. The resulting sounds that were selected in each category are
considered to be a set of equally distinguishable category members.
