We found that categorical information is more resilient to person-to-person
transfer than individuating information about the particular member of a
category being referenced. A prediction of our theory that words may be born
through the stabilization of imitation predicts that imitations that are closer
to words should also behave more like words cognitively. One of the unique
properties of words is that they facilitate categorization, which is a process
that involves abstracting across superficial similarities and seeing the ways in
which different members are related. Importantly, these properties are unique to
words, and even equally predictive nonverbal cues fail to take on the
categorical properties of words [@EdmistonLupyan2015Cognition]. If the
imitations in the telephone game are becoming more wordlike, they should also
begin to take on the categorical properties of words.
