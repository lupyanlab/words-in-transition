# Collecting transcriptions from sounds

First up was getting transcriptions from 8 hand picked imitations.
This was just a proof of principle test of the idea that transcriptions
of the imitations might have sound symbolic properties such that
they could be matched back to the original sound effect or category
of sound effects at an above chance level.

Then I got transcriptions for the 8 sound effects (seed sounds) that
gave rise to the 8 hand picked imitations. This was done so that
the properties of lexicalizations (transcriptions of sound effects)
could be compared to the transcriptions of imitations that have survived
n-generations of a telephone chain.

The next step is to expand the number of imitations and seeds that have
been described to be exhaustive of all seed sounds and the last
generation of every chain.
